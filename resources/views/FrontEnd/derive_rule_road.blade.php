</h5>
               <ul>
                <li class="ms-2">
                    Drive on the left side of the road.</li>
                <li class="ms-2">Obey all traffic signals and signs.</li>
                <li class="ms-2">Use your turn signals when changing lanes or turning.</li>
                <li class="ms-2">Give way to pedestrians at marked crossings and intersections.</li>
                <li class="ms-2">Do not drink and drive. The legal blood alcohol limit in New Zealand is 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.</li>
