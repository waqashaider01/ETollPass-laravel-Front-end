                        <h5>
                            In New Zealand, the rules for buying and selling
                            goods and services are largely governed by the Fair
                            Trading Act, which is designed to protect consumers
                            and ensure fair competition in the marketplace. Some
                            of the key provisions of the Act include:
                        </h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong> Misleading conduct:</strong>
                                It is illegal for a trader to engage in conduct
                                that is likely to mislead consumers about the
                                nature, characteristics, suitability, or
                                quantity of goods or services being offered for
                                sale.
                            </li>

                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Unfair contract terms:  </strong>
                                The Act also prohibits the use of contract terms that are deemed to be unfair to consumers..</li>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Consumer guarantees:</strong> The Act provides consumers with certain guarantees in relation to the goods and services that they purchase, including the right to have goods repaired or replaced if they are faulty.</li>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong> Layby sales:</strong>
                                The Act sets out specific rules for layby sales, which are transactions in which a consumer pays for goods in installments before taking possession of them.
                            </li>



                        </ol>
                        <p>Overall, the Fair Trading Act is intended to promote fair and honest business practices in New Zealand, and to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous traders.</p>
