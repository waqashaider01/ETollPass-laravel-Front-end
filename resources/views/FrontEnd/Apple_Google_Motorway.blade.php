                            The Apple & Google Motorway Pass features
                        </h1>
                        <p>pple and Google both offer motorway pass features as part of their mobile payment platforms. These features allow users to pay for tolls automatically using their phone or smartwatch, without the need to stop and pay at a toll booth.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Apple Motorway Pass feature is available through Apple Pay and works on toll roads in several countries, including the United States, France, and China. To use the feature, you'll need to add your car's license plate number to your Apple Pay account and turn on the Motorway Pass feature in your Apple Pay settings. When you drive through a toll, the toll amount will be automatically charged to your Apple Pay account.
                            </p>
                            <p>Google also offers a motorway pass feature through Google Pay, which is available in several countries, including the United States, Canada, and India. To use the feature, you'll need to add your car's license plate number and payment information to your Google Pay account and turn on the motorway pass feature. When you drive through a toll, the toll amount will be automatically charged to your Google Pay account.</p>
                            <p>Both the Apple Motorway Pass and Google Pay motorway pass features are designed to make it convenient and easy to pay for tolls without the need to stop and fumble with change or tickets. These features can be particularly useful for travelers who are unfamiliar with the toll roads in a particular area.</p>
