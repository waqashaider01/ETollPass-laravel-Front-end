    There are a number of steps you can take to help ensure that you drive safely while in New Zealand:
 </h5>
 <p>Vehicle safety is an important issue in New Zealand, as it can help to reduce the number of accidents and injuries on the roads. The government and other organizations work to promote vehicle safety through a number of measures, including setting safety standards for vehicles, conducting safety inspections, and enforcing safety laws.</p>
 <p>One important way that vehicle safety is promoted in New Zealand is through the warrant of fitness (WOF) system. A WOF is a regular safety inspection that all vehicles must undergo to ensure that they meet certain safety standards. The WOF inspection checks a range of vehicle systems, including brakes, lights, tires, and seatbelts, to ensure that they are in good working order. If a vehicle does not pass the WOF inspection, it cannot be driven on the roads until the necessary repairs have been made.
</p>
<p>In addition to the WOF system, there are also laws in place to ensure that vehicles are not modified in a way that could affect their safety. This includes laws on the modification of exhaust systems and the installation of aftermarket parts.</p>

<p>
    Overall, the promotion of vehicle safety is important for the safety of all road users in New Zealand. By ensuring that vehicles are safe and well-maintained, we can help to reduce the number of accidents and injuries on the roads.</p>
