                        <p>In New Zealand, there are a number of rules and regulations in place to ensure the safety of children in vehicles. These rules apply to both private and public vehicles, and are intended to reduce the risk of injury to children while they are traveling.</p>
 <h5>
    The main rules for children's safety in vehicles in New Zealand are as follows:
 </h5>
 <ol>


    <li class="ms-2">Children under the age of seven must be properly restrained in an approved child car seat or booster seat. The type of seat required depends on the child's age, weight, and height.</li>
    <li class="ms-2">Children aged seven to eight years old, or who are over 1.5 meters tall, must use a booster seat or a seatbelt.</li>
    <li class="ms-2">Children aged nine years and over must use a seatbelt.</li>
    <li class="ms-2">It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that all passengers under the age of 16 are properly restrained.</li>
</ol>
 <p>By following these rules and using appropriate restraints for children, you can help to ensure their safety while traveling in a vehicle in New Zealand.</p>
