            <h1>Road Signs in New Zealand</h1>
              <p>Road signs in New Zealand are used to provide important information to drivers, pedestrians, and other road users. They are designed to be easy to understand and follow, and they conform to international standards to ensure that they are easily recognizable by people from all countries.</p>
                <h5>
                    There are several different types of road signs in New Zealand, including:</h5>
               <ul>
                <li class="ms-2"> <strong>Regulatory signs:</strong> These signs are used to enforce traffic laws and regulations. They may include speed limit signs, stop signs, and yield signs.</li>
                <li class="ms-2"><strong>Warning signs:</strong> These signs are used to alert road users to potential hazards or changes in the road ahead. They may include curve ahead signs, railway crossing signs, and slippery road signs.</li>

                <li class="ms-2"><strong>Guide signs:</strong> These signs provide directions and information to help road users navigate the road network. They may include destination signs, distance markers, and directional signs.</li>
                <li class="ms-2"><strong>Information signs:</strong> These signs provide important information about services and facilities, such as rest areas, hospitals, and petrol stations</li>

            </ul>
              <p>
                It is important to pay attention to road signs and follow their instructions while driving in New Zealand. Failing to do so could result in accidents, traffic violations, and other consequences.</p>
