                        <P>In New Zealand, the planning and investment of
                            transportation is primarily the responsibility of
                            the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA). The NZTA is
                            a Crown entity that is responsible for the
                            development and implementation of national transport
                            policies and strategies.</P>
                        <P>The NZTA works closely with local authorities and
                            other organizations to plan and invest in
                            transportation infrastructure and services in New
                            Zealand. This includes the development of new roads,
                            the maintenance and improvement of existing roads,
                            the planning of public transport services, and the
                            promotion of active modes of transportation such as
                            walking and cycling.</P>
                        <P>The NZTA is also responsible for the allocation of
                            funding for transportation projects and initiatives.
                            This funding comes from a variety of sources,
                            including government grants, tolls, and user
                            charges.</P>
                        <P>Overall, the goal of transportation planning and
                            investment in New Zealand is to create a safe,
                            efficient, and sustainable transport system that
                            meets the needs of the country's people and
                            businesses.</P>
