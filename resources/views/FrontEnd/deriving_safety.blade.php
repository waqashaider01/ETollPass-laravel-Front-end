    There are a number of steps you can take to help ensure that you drive safely while in New Zealand:
 </h5>
 <ol>

 <li class="ms-2"><strong>Familiarize yourself with the road rules:</strong>      It is important to understand the rules of the road and follow them at all times. This will help you to avoid accidents and keep you and other road users safe.</li>
 <li class="ms-2"><strong>Be aware of your surroundings:           </strong>       Keep an eye out for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, and be prepared to adjust your driving accordingly.</li>
 <li class="ms-2"><strong>Stay alert and avoid distractions:       </strong>       Do not use your phone or any other electronic devices while driving, and try to avoid other distractions such as eating or drinking.</li>
 <li class="ms-2"><strong>Wear your seatbelt:                      </strong>       It is the law to wear a seatbelt in New Zealand, and it can save your life in the event of an accident.</li>
 <li class="ms-2"><strong>Don't drink and drive:                   </strong>       It is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of over 0.08%, and the consequences of drink driving can be severe.</li>
 </ol>
