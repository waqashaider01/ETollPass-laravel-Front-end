                            In New Zealand, all vehicles must be registered with the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) in order to be used on public roads. The process for registering a vehicle typically includes the following steps:
                        </h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Get an ownership certificate:</strong> Before you can register a vehicle, you must have an ownership certificate (also known as a "certificate of title") showing that you are the owner of the vehicle.</li>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Obtain a warrant of fitness: </strong> Most vehicles in New Zealand are required to have a warrant of fitness (WOF), which is a document that certifies that the vehicle is safe to be driven on the road.</li>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Get third party insurance:   </strong> In New Zealand, all vehicles must have third party insurance, which covers any damage or injury that you may cause to other people or their property while driving.</li>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Register the vehicle:        </strong> Once you have obtained an ownership certificate, WOF, and third party insurance, you can then register the vehicle with the NZTA. This typically involves filling out a registration application form and paying a fee.</li>
                            <li class="ms-2"><strong>Get a license plate:         </strong> After your vehicle has been registered, you will be issued with a license plate, which must be displayed on the vehicle at all times when it is being driven on the road.</li>



                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the process for registering a vehicle in New Zealand is designed to ensure that all vehicles on the road are safe, properly insured, and legally owned..</p>
